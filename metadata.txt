name=SmartSnap - Geometry Snap & Topology Cleaner
qgisMinimumVersion=3.16
version=1.0.0

description=Automatically snaps, fixes, and cleans vector geometries by aligning nearby vertices and removing topological errors. Ideal for road networks, boundaries, utilities, and survey datasets.

about=SmartSnap automatically detects and adjusts misaligned vertices so features within a specified tolerance become spatially coincident. It also removes duplicate geometries and cleans dangling short segments. Perfect for preparing datasets for network analysis, spatial modeling, infrastructure mapping, and digitization QA/QC workflows.
